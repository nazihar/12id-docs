# The 12iD credential model

**For:** the product owners and developers of organisations that issue or verify credentials with 12iD.
**Describes:** what a 12iD credential is, how long it is valid, why it cannot be revoked, what happens when
a user loses their phone, and how to design schemas whose values work in proofs. Read it before you design
your first schema: some of these choices cannot be changed later.

Related: the API guide ([`api.md`](api.md)), data protection ([`data-protection.md`](data-protection.md)) and
the Android SDK guide ([the Android SDK guide](android-sdk.md)).

## What a credential is

A credential is a set of named values that your organisation signs and gives to one person. For example:
name, employee number, department, valid until. The person keeps it in the wallet inside **your** app, on
their phone. Later, a verifier (you or another organisation) asks the wallet for a proof, and the wallet
shows only what that request asks for:
- selected values, such as name and department;
- facts about values that reveal nothing else, such as "employee number above 1000" or "valid today".

What lives where:

| | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| The credential | Only on the user's phone | 12iD keeps no copy and cannot read the wallet |
| The schema (the list of value *names*) and your credential definition (your signing key's public part) | The public Indy ledger | Never any value or personal data |
| The exchange record (who was offered what, and when) | 12iD's platform, for you | Values are erased after your retention period ([`data-protection.md`](data-protection.md)) |

## Validity: every credential expires

There is no revocation in this version of 12iD, so **expiry is how a credential stops being accepted.**

- **Every schema contains `expiresOn`.** The console adds it when you publish a schema.
- **You set it on every offer.** It is the expiry date as `YYYYMMDD`, as a string (`"20271231"` is 31 December 2027), today or later. Dates are UTC.
- **The credential is accepted through the end of that day** (until 23:59:59 UTC), and refused from the next day.
- **Every proof request checks it automatically** (`expiresOn >= today`), and you cannot remove that check. An expired credential fails every proof, and the wallet still keeps it.
- **`expiresOn` is never disclosed.** A proof only shows that the credential is still valid, not its date.
- **Any date up to the year 9999 works.** Expiry is a whole day, not a time of day.

**Choose the validity period for each credential type.** A shorter period limits how long a credential you
can no longer stand behind stays usable. A longer one means fewer re-issues. As a guide: months for access
and membership, a year or two for qualifications, with re-issue on renewal.

## No revocation: what it means for you

- **An issued credential cannot be withdrawn before its `expiresOn` date.** This holds even when the person leaves your organisation, or you erase your records of the exchange ([`data-protection.md`](data-protection.md), "What erasure does not do").
- **If the facts change** (new department, new expiry), issue a new credential. The verifier's proof request decides which credentials it accepts. The user's app can delete the old one; you cannot delete it remotely.
- **If you need early invalidation** (for example for high-risk access), keep expiry short and re-issue often, and talk to us. Revocation would need new credential definitions, so it cannot be added to credentials already issued.

## Wallet recovery: accept the loss, issue again

A wallet's keys live in the phone's secure hardware and never leave it. **There is no backup or export in
this version.** These all mean a new, empty wallet:
- a lost or replaced phone;
- a reinstalled app;
- cleared app data;
- the wallet files restored onto another device. The SDK reports `WalletKeyLost`, because the key stayed on the old phone.

What happens and what you do:
1. The app gets a new wallet. Your backend creates it with `POST /v1/wallets` (a new installation id gives a new wallet; a person may have several).
2. **You issue the person's credentials again.** Make this one step for the user: keep the facts you issued from in your own systems, and offer the credentials again when the new wallet connects to you.
3. The old credentials are gone with the old phone. Nobody else can use them: a proof needs the wallet's key, and that key never left the device.
4. Revoke the old installation's wallet token with `DELETE /v1/wallets/{id}`, and optionally erase the old connection (`POST /v1/connections/{id}/erase`). 12iD removes a revoked wallet's mediator connection after 30 days.

The SDK guide shows the app side (`reset()`, `WalletKeyLost`, and excluding the wallet from Android
backups, so it is never restored where its key is missing).

## Attribute values: how to encode them

Credentials are built on AnonCreds, which signs **strings**. Getting the encoding right at schema design
time is the most common source of mistakes.

**Rules**
- **Every value is a string.** There are no nested objects, arrays, booleans or number types.
- **Predicates (`>=`, `>`, `<=`, `<`) work only on whole numbers** from `-2147483648` to `2147483647`, written as plain digits, optionally with a leading `-`. Anything else (decimals, numbers above that range, text) is stored as a hash: the value can be disclosed but cannot be compared.
- `"00123"` and `"123"` compare as the same number. Store identifiers that must keep their leading zeros as text, and never compare them.
- An empty string is allowed and disclosed as empty.

**Recipes**

| You want | Store as | Example | Predicate example |
|---|---|---|---|
| A date someone may need to compare (birth date, start date) | Days or a compact integer: `YYYYMMDD` | `"19851103"` | Over 18 on 2026-10-05: `dateOfBirth <= 20081005` |
| A date only to display | ISO 8601 text | `"1985-11-03"` | none (text) |
| An amount | Integer in the smallest unit | `"125000"` (cents) | `salary >= 5000000` |
| Yes/no | `"1"` / `"0"` | `"1"` | `isAdult >= 1` |
| A choice from a list | Short text code | `"ENGINEERING"` | none; disclose it |
| A document | Its hash or a reference | `"sha256:9f86…"` | none |
| A time to compare, to the minute | Minutes since 1970-01-01 UTC (fits until the year 6053) | `"29979360"` (2027-01-01 00:00 UTC) | `validFromMinute <= <now in minutes>` |

`YYYYMMDD` compares correctly as a number (`20081005 > 19851103`) and stays readable. Use it for every date
a verifier may test with a predicate.

**Limits on an offer:** at most 125 attributes, names up to 100 characters, values up to 4 KB, and 64 KB for
all names and values together. Credentials carry claims, not documents.

## Schemas cannot change

- A published schema is permanent on the ledger: its attribute names never change.
- **Adding or renaming a field means a new schema version** (and a new credential definition).
- Deprecate the old version in the console to stop new offers. Proof templates that name the schema accept every version, so credentials issued before the change keep working.
- Plan names carefully: use lower camel case, no personal data in names, and include `expiresOn` (added for you).

## Checklist before your first schema

1. List the values; for each, decide "disclose" or "compare". Every "compare" value must be a whole number in range.
2. Pick the validity period, and how you will re-issue (renewal, changed facts, a new phone).
3. Decide how a user gets their credentials again on a new phone, and make it one step.
4. Keep personal data out of `externalId` and out of attribute *names*.
5. Publish in the staging environment first, issue to a test wallet, and run your proof templates against it.
